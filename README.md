# How to run the model



## Training

Install all the libraries and dependencies with pip before running the command

```bash
  python main.py --mode train --model_path ./path/to/model.pth --dataset_path ./path/to/dataset
```

To run, you do not need to change anything about this command including the paths, run it as it is.
